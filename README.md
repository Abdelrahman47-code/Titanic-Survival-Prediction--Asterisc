# Titanic-Survival-Prediction--Asterisc

### This repo contains an ML project focused on the Titanic dataset. The project aims to predict passenger survival based on various features such as age, class, and embarkation point.

### Key Points:
- Explored and visualized dataset features.
- Conducted data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Evaluated models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting.
- The Logistic Regression model emerged as the top performer with an accuracy of 82%.
